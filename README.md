## Netscape to JSON

-Netscape to json  is necessary and must be run separately, make sure that the file is run separately and also do not forget to save a copy of your cookies, since they are edited immediately in json format.


## Main file

-You can change the time of use of this file, and the asynchronous is not used, however, you can add it by changing a few lines, I do not recommend doing this to people who have unstable Internet connection or dirty cookies
-cd ~Directory
-pip install -r requirements.txt
-python netscape_to_json.py - > after starting this file drop path to your folder where cookies are contained ( do not forget to do a copy of your cookies before running)
-python main.py
